This is a handmade compiler for the B pseudo-language.
I've been wanting to finish this project for the longest time, but since i was too busy to focus on it, it's taken me much longer than expected. 

I'm gonna explain how my compiler works and go through all the logic, from the scanner to the optimization algorithms. The goal is to explain compilers through my code in a way that will teach you how to make your own(in the case you don't know how to), i hope y'all enjoy it, but more importantly i hope it teaches you a thing or two about compilers.
